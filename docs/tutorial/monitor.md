## Frequency-domain field and power monitor
- **Feature Description:**
Frequency domain field monitors work in the frequency domain and extract the field profiles across some spatial regions of the FDTD simulation.

- **General tab:**

!['monitor_3'](../../static/monitor_3.png)

1 ) ***Override Global Options:*** This is a toggle for overriding the global monitor settings. Checking this option enables the user to specify the frequency spans and number of points at which frequency-domain data will be collected. Otherwise the following options should be specified from the global monitor settings.

2 ) ***Sample Spacing:*** The sampling frequency or wavelength is determined somehow based on this choice parameter. Only the "uniform" option is available at present.
 
3 ) ***Use Source Limits:*** If the “**Use Source Limits**” state is turned on, the settings for “**Spacing Type**”, “**Spacing Limit**”, “**Wavelength Min/Max**” are disabled. Otherwise, the user can change the above settings in this section.
4 ) ***Frequency Points:*** Sets to choose the number of frequency points at which to record data. (Default: 5)


- **General Tab**

!['monitor_4'](../../static/monitor_4.png)

1 )	***Monitor Type:*** The monitor type and orientation, this option will control the available of spatial setting below, ***Point, Linear X/Y/Z, 2D X-Normal/2D Y-Normal/2D Z-Normal, 3D*** are included. ( Default: 2D X-normal)

2 )	***X/X Span; Y/Y Span; Z/Z Span:***
***X, Y, Z:*** The center position of the simulation region.

***X Min, X Max:*** X min, X max position.

- **Data to Record tab:**

!['monitor_5'](../../static/monitor_5.png)

1 )	***Fields & Poynting vector and power:*** Output quantities EX, EY, EZ, HX, HY, HZ, PX, PY, PZ: The user can select from the field components (EX, EY, EZ, HX, HY, HZ) or the Poynting vector (PX, PY, PZ) those ones he/she wishes to measure. For 3D simulations, only part of the components are non-vanishing (i.e., for TE simulations only EX, EY, and HZ will make sense). However to facilitate fast switches between TE and TM simulations, all the field quantities will remain active.(2D simulation is inavailable at present).

2 )	***Output Power:*** The user can check this option to compute the power as an integral over the monitor surface, and it is for surface minitors (3D simultion) and line monitors (2D simulation) only. Once the simulation comes to end, this uses much less memory and is therefore rather appropriate for large parallel computations where only the integrated power over a surface is requested by the user. (2D FDTD is inavailable at present).

->***Nyquist Limit:*** The Nyquist limit of sampling is determined in accordance with the maximum frequencies that may arise in the simulation region.

->***Actual Sampling:*** The actual rate of sampling is identical to the rate that is actually employed for the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), by appropriately taking the desired sampling rate, the Nyquist limit, and the time step dt into account

!['monitor_7'](../../static/monitor_7.png)

The Mode Expansion tab contains two main sections. The "Mode calculation" section allows you to select a mode (or a set of modes) to expand the input profile. The "Monitors for Expansion" section allows you to choose a field profile from an arbitrary monitor in the simulation to expand.

->Radius: Radius of the bent waveguide. (Default value: 1.000e+6 μm)

->Orientation: Orientation of the bent waveguide
	Location: Loaction of the bent waveguide. (at Simulation Center by default)
 
5 )	***Rotations:***
->***Theta:***This refers to the angle of propagation measured by degrees, with respect to the incident axis of the source in a 3D simulation. In a 2D simulation, it is the angle of propagation measured by degrees revolved around the global Z-axis in compliance with the right-hand rule, that is, the angle of propagation in the XY plane.

->***Phi:*** This refers to the angle of propagation measured by degrees revolved around the incident axis of the source in compliance with the right-hand rule in a 3D simulation. In a 2D simulation, this value does not take effect.

->***Rotation Offset:*** A rotation offset can be endowed to the plane upon which the mode is computed. This guarantees that mode sources at an angle do not interfere with structures not belonging to the waveguide/fiber.

### FDTD Far Field

**Feature Description:** The FDTD far field function is used for calculating the EM fields in the far field region of the selected “Frequency-Domain Field and Power Monitor” through adopting a systematic near-to-far-field (NTFF) transformation without the necessity of extending the simulation region to the actual far field area. After a single FDTD simulation, the frequency-domain field data of the selected monitor can be accurately and efficiently projected to the far field region defined by a hemisphere with a radius of 1 meter which is positioned 1 meter away from the center of the monitor.
